Make game play smoother over all. Swap out player, enemy, missile, and background with new images.

Get Game To Work/Play:
1. On line 107 uncomment gameLoop();
2. Should be able to move around and fire.
3. There is not collision detetection, removal of enemies once they get to the bottom, score, or respawning of enemies.
4. That will be added to in later repos.
